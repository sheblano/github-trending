# GitHub Trending Explorer

> Because [github.com/trending](https://github.com/trending) is great for a quick glance, but not enough when you want to **filter, track, score, and stay on top of** the repos that actually matter to you.

A self-hosted web app that supercharges GitHub's trending page with persistent starring, release tracking, watchlist scoring, radar-mode ranking, a timeline of notable events, and more — all without any AI dependency.

**This project was vibe-coded with my technical direction and architectural guidance.** Every feature, data model, and UX decision was deliberately shaped — the AI pair-programming just made it faster to ship.

---

## Why this exists

GitHub's native trending page gives you a flat list of popular repos for today, this week, or this month. That's it. No search. No topic filters. No way to save what you find. No way to know if a repo is actually healthy or just had a one-day spike.

I wanted something that lets me:

- **Search and filter** trending repos by language, topics, date range, and sort order — then **save those filter combos** as reusable presets
- **Star repos** and have them sync with my GitHub account, with **personal notes** attached
- **Track releases** for repos I follow, with unseen badges so I never miss an update
- **Score repos** on health and momentum so I can tell the difference between a flash-in-the-pan and a project worth depending on
- **Rank by signal, not just stars** — a radar mode that surfaces fast-rising, well-maintained repos
- **See a timeline** of notable events: new releases, star spikes, repos entering the radar

So I built it.

## Features

### Discovery & filtering

- **Trending grid** with infinite scroll, powered by GitHub's search API
- **Language filter** — JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C++, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Ruby, PHP, Dart, Zig, Elixir, Scala, or All
- **Topic chips** — Machine Learning, AI, Deep Learning, LLM, DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless, React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, CLI, Database, API, Security, Testing, Blockchain, Web3, Game Dev
- **Date range** — Today / This Week / This Month
- **Sort** by Stars, Forks, or Last Updated, ascending or descending
- **Debounced search** across repo names and descriptions
- **Filter presets** — save your favorite filter combos (cloud-synced when signed in, localStorage when anonymous)

### Watchlist confidence score

Every repo card shows a **numeric score (0–100)** and a **label** (Strong / Watch / Cooling / Risky) computed from:

- Commit recency and push activity
- Star count and growth momentum (from cached star history samples)
- Fork activity
- Open issue load relative to popularity
- License presence
- Archive status

Hover for a tooltip listing the specific reasons behind the score.

### Radar mode

Toggle between **Default** (GitHub's ranking) and **Radar** (momentum + health ranking). Radar mode:

- Re-sorts repos by a weighted signal combining watch score, star growth velocity, push freshness, and topic breadth
- Shows a **radar rank** chip per repo
- Highlights **"hot" repos** (score >= 72) with a purple accent border
- Surfaces reasons like *"Strong star growth"*, *"Recently pushed"*, *"Fresh commits"*

### Repo cards at a glance

Each card displays: owner avatar, full name (linked), description, primary language, formatted star count, forks, last push date, commit recency health chip (Active / Slowing / Stale), open issue count, license (or "No License" warning), archive status, and up to 5 topic chips.

### Star history sparkline

When signed in, each repo card lazy-loads a **mini sparkline chart** showing weekly star growth — sampled from the GitHub Stargazers API and cached for 24 hours.

### README preview

Click the article icon on any card to open a **side drawer** with the repo's rendered README — no need to leave the app. Includes a direct "Open on GitHub" link.

### Starring & tracking

- **Star / unstar repos** directly from the trending page — syncs with your actual GitHub stars
- **Starred tab** with your followed repos, follow dates, and an **unstar** action
- **Personal notes** per repo — type in a textarea, auto-saved on blur

### Release notes

- **Release Notes tab** aggregates the latest releases across all your starred repos
- **Unseen badge** on the tab when there are new releases you haven't checked
- Each release shows tag, date, rendered body, and a link to the GitHub release page

### Weekly digest

A **bell icon** in the toolbar (signed in) opens a digest menu:

- Count of repos with new releases since your last check
- "Trending in your languages" — personalized picks based on the languages of your starred repos
- Red dot indicator for unseen updates; auto-marked as seen when opened

### Timeline

A dedicated **Timeline page** showing chronological events:

- **Release published** — when a starred repo pushes a new release
- **Star spike** — when a trending repo gains significant stars between snapshots
- **Entered radar** — when a repo's radar score crosses the "hot" threshold

Filter by repo name or event type. Events are derived from throttled snapshots recorded during trending fetches (no background scheduler needed for MVP).

### Progressive Web App

Installable as a PWA with an offline-capable shell via Angular Service Worker.

### Responsive design

Full **mobile-first** layout: bottom tab navigation on small screens, scrollable chip rows, stacked controls, and a single-column repo grid.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + Compose v2)
- A **GitHub OAuth App** — [create one here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)

  | Field                      | Value                                     |
  | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
  | Application name           | e.g. *Trending Explorer (local)*          |
  | Homepage URL               | `http://localhost:4200`                   |
  | Authorization callback URL | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` |


### Run with Docker

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/sheblano/github-trending.git
cd github-trending
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env — add your GitHub OAuth credentials and generate secrets
#    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
#    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret>
#    SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
#    ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# 3. Build and start
docker compose up --build

# 4. Open the app
open http://localhost:4200
```

The backend auto-creates all database tables on first startup — no manual migration needed.

### Local development (without Docker)

```bash
# Start only the database
docker compose up postgres -d

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client and push schema
npx prisma generate --schema=apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma
npx prisma db push --schema=apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma

# Start both apps
npx nx run-many -t serve -p frontend backend
```

The Angular dev server (`:4200`) proxies `/api/*` to the Next.js server (`:3000`).

## Using with OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is a self-hosted personal AI assistant that runs across 20+ messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, and more). Because this app exposes a clean REST API, it can be wired up as an OpenClaw skill to surface trending repo insights wherever you already chat.

### What this enables

With a thin OpenClaw skill pointing at your running instance, you could ask your assistant things like:

- *"What's trending in Rust this week?"* — queries `/api/repos/trending?language=Rust&dateRange=weekly`
- *"Show me the radar top 10"* — queries with `viewMode=radar&perPage=10`
- *"Any star spikes today?"* — queries `/api/timeline?eventType=star_spike`
- *"New releases from my starred repos?"* — queries `/api/releases`
- *"Weekly digest"* — queries `/api/digest`

The results come back as structured JSON, which OpenClaw can format into a readable message for your channel of choice.

### API endpoints useful for a skill


| Endpoint                                     | What it returns                                                                                                             |

### Sketch of a skill

An OpenClaw skill lives in `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/github-trending/SKILL.md` and typically includes trigger phrases, the API base URL, and formatting instructions. A minimal example:

```markdown
---
name: github-trending
version: 1.0.0
description: Query your self-hosted GitHub Trending Explorer
triggers:
  - trending repos
  - radar repos
  - star spikes
  - new releases
  - weekly digest
---

# GitHub Trending Explorer Skill

Query the self-hosted GitHub Trending Explorer API at `${TRENDING_API_URL}`.

## Trending repos
When the user asks about trending repos, call:
`GET ${TRENDING_API_URL}/api/repos/trending`

Supported query params: `language`, `topics` (comma-separated), `dateRange` (daily/weekly/monthly), `q` (search), `sort` (stars/forks/updated), `order` (asc/desc), `viewMode` (default/radar), `page`, `perPage`.

Format each repo as: **name** — description (score / label).

## Timeline events
When the user asks about star spikes, releases entering the radar, or recent events:
`GET ${TRENDING_API_URL}/api/timeline`

Params: `repo` (owner/name), `eventType` (release_published/star_spike/entered_radar), `since` (ISO date), `limit`.

## Digest
`GET ${TRENDING_API_URL}/api/digest` (requires auth cookie forwarding or token).
```

Because both projects are MIT-licensed and self-hosted, you own the full stack — no third-party API keys beyond your own GitHub OAuth app.
